okay lets start by Event Creation System:
we need to
1-Build an event creation form with step-by-step wizard interface
first after the user logs in for the first time he is asked is he wants to create an event or attend to one so we will create a simple 2 card choice {Create an event, Find an Event} If the user choosed to Create an event we will direct him to choose a category so thats when we would Implement category selection- a frontend with simple grid card for each category: Business
Food & Drink
Health
Music
Auto, Boat & Air
Charity & Causes
Community
Family & Education
Fashion
Film & Media
Parties
Hobbies
Home & Lifestyle
Performing & Visual Arts
Government
Spirituality
School Activities
Science & Tech
Holidays
Sports & Fitness
Travel & Outdoor
Other
right after he chooses the category he will be directed then to a form where he is asked for Event title - Event Date (React → react-datepicker, @mui/x-date-pickers, react-day-picker choose the one most suitable) - Location (managed by google maps you will find the api details below take your time to analyze them and adapt them to our needs) and Expected Attendance as an int and 0 if the user is not sure how much 

below is how we must configure the maps api:

so first we need to gather some informations about the longtitude and latitude that will be passed to our api The point around which to retrieve place information. 
and we will use A GET REQUEST TO https://ipinfo.io/json
which will response with {
  "ip": "105.156.7.169",
  "city": "Casablanca",
  "region": "Casablanca-Settat",
  "country": "MA",
  "loc": "33.5883,-7.6114",
  "org": "AS36903 Office National des Postes et Telecommunications ONPT (Maroc Telecom) / IAM",
  "postal": "29640",
  "timezone": "Africa/Casablanca",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
} for exemple and we need to retreive   "loc": "33.5883,-7.6114", so we can pass it to the next api
curl --request GET 
	--url 'https://google-map-places.p.rapidapi.com/maps/api/place/queryautocomplete/json?input={PLACE_TO_LOOK_FOR}&language={default:en}&location={latitude,longitude}&offset=3' 
	--header 'x-rapidapi-host: google-map-places.p.rapidapi.com' 
	--header 'x-rapidapi-key: 37fee07720msh40f36f83c438a85p14f0e4jsncb74da8d4371'
	
please make sure to handle all these requirements and if you need to create an api endpoint in the server please do so 

Here's a refined and structured prompt for your Event Creation System, optimized for implementation with ReactJS, Django, and Cursor 3.7:

---

**Event Creation System Requirements**

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Backend: Django
- LLM: Cursor 3.7
- Maps API: Google Maps Places (via RapidAPI)
- IP Geolocation: ipinfo.io

**User Flow:**
1. **Initial Choice (Post-Login):**
   - Display two card options: 
     - "Create an Event" 
     - "Find an Event"
   - Styled as visually appealing cards with icons

2. **Category Selection (If Create Event Chosen):**
   - Grid layout of category cards (24 categories provided=Business, Food & Drink, Health, Music, Auto, Boat & Air, Charity & Causes, Community, Family & Education, Fashion, Film & Media, Parties, Hobbies, Home & Lifestyle, Performing & Visual Arts, Government, Spirituality, School Activities, Science & Tech, Holidays, Sports & Fitness, Travel & Outdoor, Other)
   - Responsive design (3-5 columns depending on screen size)
   - Visual feedback on hover/selection

3. **Event Creation Form (Wizard Steps):**
   - **Step 1:** Basic Information
     - Event Title (text input with validation)
     - Event Date (recommend react-datepicker for simplicity)
     - Location (implement Google Maps integration as below)
     - Expected Attendance (number input, defaults to 0)

**Google Maps Implementation:**
1. **IP Geolocation:**
   - Create Django endpoint `/api/get-initial-location/`
   - Calls ipinfo.io API (GET https://ipinfo.io/json)
   - Extracts "loc" field (lat,lng)
   - Returns to frontend as { lat, lng }

2. **Place Autocomplete:**
   - Create Django endpoint `/api/search-locations/`
   - Accepts parameters: 
     - `query` (search term)
     - `location` (from IP geolocation)
   - Proxies to RapidAPI:
     ```
     GET https://google-map-places.p.rapidapi.com/maps/api/place/queryautocomplete/json
     Headers:
       x-rapidapi-host: google-map-places.p.rapidapi.com
       x-rapidapi-key: [your_key add a placeholder to .env and .env.exmple]
     Parameters:
       input={query}
       language=en
       location={lat,lng}
       offset=3
     ```

3. **Frontend Components:**
   - LocationSearch.js:
     - On mount: calls `/api/get-initial-location/`
     - Search input that debounces requests to `/api/search-locations/`
     - Displays results in dropdown
     - Selected location stored in form state

**Additional Requirements:**
- Form validation at each step
- Progress indicator for multi-step wizard
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Error handling for API failures
- Loading states during API calls

**Suggested Django API Endpoints:**
1. `GET /api/get-initial-location/` - Gets approximate location from IP
2. `GET /api/search-locations/` - Proxies to Google Places API
3. `POST /api/events/` - Final event submission

**Security Considerations:**
- Rate limiting on location APIs
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Store API keys in Django environment variables
- CORS configuration for frontend access


    Post-registration choice interface → 2. Category selection → 3. Multi-step event creation form

Technical Requirements:

    Choice Page Component

        Design two prominent action cards:

            "Create Event" (primary action)

            "Find Event" (secondary action)

        Visual requirements:
            Modern card design with relevant icons
            Hover animations (scale transform + shadow)
            Mobile-responsive grid (stacked on small screens)
        Behavior: Clicking "Create Event" navigates to /categories
    Category Selection Interface
        Display all 24 categories in a responsive grid (4 columns on desktop, 2 on mobile)
        Each category should have:
            Representative icon
            Category name
            Subtle background color variation
        Implement:
            Search bar for category filtering (debounced)
            Selected state visualization (border highlight + shadow)
        On selection: Navigate to /create-event/[category]
    Multi-Step Event Creation Wizard
    Step 1: Basic Information
        Form fields:
            Event Title (required, max 60 chars)
            Event Date (using react-datepicker with:
                Min date validation
                Time selection
                Mobile-friendly popup)
            Location (Google Maps integration):
                Implement IP-based default location (via ipinfo.io)
                Places autocomplete with dropdown
                Map preview (static image from Google Maps API)
            Expected Attendance (number input with 0 as default)
        Validation:
            Real-time field validation
            Clear error messages
            Disabled continue button until valid
